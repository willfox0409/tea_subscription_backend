# README

> ‚öôÔ∏è This is the **backend** repo for the Rock & Brew: Legendary Tea Subscriptions project.  
It includes all Rails API logic, database schema, serializers, and request specs.  
The full project (including frontend documentation and screenshots) is documented below.

# üçµ Rock & Brew: Legendary Tea Subscriptions

A full-stack admin portal for managing tea subscriptions, built with a Rails API backend and a React frontend. This project was completed as a solo assessment over 3 days, following MVP principles and RESTful best practices.

## üìÅ Project Structure

**Backend**: Ruby on Rails API  
**Frontend**: React (Vite + React Router DOM)  
**Testing**: RSpec (BE), Cypress (FE)  
**Database**: PostgreSQL  
**Documentation**: JSON:API-style contracts, Postman collection

## üìå MVP Features

### Backend API

- Full CRUD functionality for subscriptions (GET, PATCH)
- Nested data relationships between Subscriptions, Customers, and Teas
- Filter endpoint for `/subscriptions?status=`
- JSON:API-compliant serialization
- Custom error handling via `rescue_from`
- Model-level scope: `Subscription.with_status(status)`
- Postman collection built to test and validate endpoints

### Frontend

- Home page shows all Subscriptions with name, status, frequency, and mapped image
- Subscriptions are filterable by `active`, `cancelled`, or `all`
- Clicking ‚ÄúView Details‚Äù shows full tea & customer data
- `Teas` and `Customers` pages display lists (with images for teas)
- Local image mapping for both Subscriptions and Teas
- Fully responsive layout, tested across screen sizes

## üß† Planning & Architecture

### Component Tree

- `App` (Router & Nav)
  - `SubscriptionList`
    - `SubscriptionCard`
  - `SubscriptionDetails`
  - `CustomersView`
  - `TeasView`
 
### Component Architecture Diagram

### Design Decisions

- **Asset Mapping**: Tea and Subscription images are stored locally and mapped using JS objects based on title strings.
- **No Auth**: Since this is an internal admin tool, authentication was not included.
- **Responsiveness**: Simple flex/grid layout supports clean display across screen sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Custom 404, 400, and 422 JSON responses from Rails.

## üß™ Testing

### Backend

- 100% SimpleCov line coverage
- RSpec request and model specs:
  - Happy paths
  - Sad paths (invalid params, not found, invalid status)
- Postman collection for manual endpoint validation

### Frontend

- Cypress e2e tests for:
  - Home page rendering
  - Navigation to details page
  - Customers and Teas view rendering
- Tests are basic, and do not currently include sad path or network error simulation
